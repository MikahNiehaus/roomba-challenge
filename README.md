# Roomba

**My task was to build a virtual hoover**

**Task specifications**

You will write a web application that drives an imaginary robotic hoover (much like a Roomba) around an equally imaginary room based on:

    room dimensions as X and Y coordinates, identifying the top right corner of the room rectangle. This room is divided up in a grid based on these dimensions; a room that has dimensions X: 5 and Y: 5 has 5 columns and 5 rows, so 25 possible hoover positions. The bottom left corner is the point of origin for our coordinate system, so as the room contains all coordinates its bottom left corner is defined by X: 0 and Y: 0.
    an initial hoover position (X and Y coordinates like patches of dirt)
    locations of patches of dirt, also defined by X and Y coordinates identifying the bottom left corner of those grid positions.

The room will be rectangular, has no obstacles (except the room walls), no doors and all locations in the room will be clean (hoovering has no effect) except for the locations of the patches of dirt presented in the program input.

Placing the hoover on a patch of dirt ("hoovering") removes the patch of dirt so that patch is then clean for the remainder of the program run. The hoover is always on - there is no need to enable it.

Driving into a wall has no effect (the robot skids in place).
Goal

The goal of the application is to take the room dimensions, the locations of the dirt patches, and the hoover location as input and to allow the user to navigate the robot around the room.

As a minimum you should build an interface with:

    A way to enter the following configuration:
        the room dimensions (length and width)
        the starting location of the robot (as coordinates)
        the locations of zero or more dirt patches
    Four buttons which will move the robot North, South, East and West
    A visual representation of the room state
    A text based representation of the robot's position within the room
    A text based representation of the number of dirt patches which have been hoovered

Deliverable

The program:

    link to a running web page
    must run in all modern browsers
    can be written in any client side programming language.
    can make use of any existing open source libraries that don't directly address the problem statement (use your best judgement)

What will be especially considered:

    Actually solving the problem
    Overall user experience
    Code organisation
    Quality
    Testing
    Readability

## Tech Stack

React JS, Jest, Sinon, Enzyme.


## Installation

- Run 'git clone https://github.com/JoshuaJFHolloway/Roomba-challenge' in your terminal


## Usage

- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start'
- Visit 'localhost:3000' in your browser to see the app


## Approach

The first thing I did was draw out what I thought the application would look like. Following the
instructions set for what would minimally achieve what was being looked for. By doing this I could
determine what components I would need and where I would keep state.

It came apparent to me that there are different ways to bring this Roomba application to life, but
to me the easiest way was to make every single tile a component which knows its own ID. This way it would
be easier to pass certain properties to it. It would mount and check to see whether its dirty or whether
Roomba has been to clean it. It made sense to me and felt natural.

Creating the grid was interesting. I haven't created a grid of components before, but it worked out
well. I was looking at libraries to create a grid for me at the beginning however I quickly realised
that I would learn a lot more by just creating it myself.

I am aware that the brief stated "A text based representation of the robot's position within the room" and
I considered a visual representation of where Roomba is in the room to be an upgrade of that. I could have 
very easily shown a text representation of Roomba's current coordinates as they are constantly updated in App.js's
state as it moves. Its literally a x and y object that I could pass down to a string to display in game, but I just
didn't think it added anything to the user experience beyond the visual representation I created.

### Edge Cases

I tried to cover edge cases with how the app functions. The inputs have maximum and minimum restrictions on them
to prevent anyone from putting a dirt tile or roomba outside of the parameters of the room. You cannot press the submit
button to progress to the grid until these inputs are fixed. Furthermore, once you press the submit button
the inputs disappear. This was a conscious decision for two main reasons. Firstly, the inputs cannot be altered once in game
to cause an error or mess up the grid. Secondly, it means that the interface is a lot cleaner. The grid page having only
a grid and the buttons to move roomba is a much smarter and sleeker page than one that also has the inputs beneath still.

### Why React?

I chose React because I could envisage how the props being passed down to each tile would change with every
click of a navigation button. With these props changing, it would mean that the individual tile components would refresh
and that would allow it to re-run the functions to check whether its dirty or whether Roomba has arrived or been.

There is a downside to my current functionality of the application and that is the fact that those aforementioned
functions run each time the props change. This is both a positive and a negative. Positive because it gives the game
greater flexibility in the future to add new features (such as random dirt patches appearing in game feature). But
arguably it is a bit cumbersome for the Tile components to be making these checks if it isn't dirty from the beginning.
If it isn't set as dirty from the off then it has no need to check whether it is dirty or whether Roomba has been and gone.
This is something I will look at in the future.


## Things I am not happy with

1. The math.random function used as a key for one of the loops.

I will look to find a way more elegant solution to this.

2. Functions in the App.js that show repetition like all the direction functions. 

I will be looking to find a way to group them into a function that calls the correct direction
function depending upon an argument passed to the wrapping function. This way it prevents the 
repetition of functions like setting the state and the cleanTile function.

3. Having not tested the createColumns function in the Grid.js.

This is where I need to improve in my Jest/Enzyme/Sinon testing. I had some troubles with syntax.

4. Having not tested Compass, CompassAndGridWrapper and RoombaInputs.js.

I didn't test them because they had minimal to no logic in them. They are 99% HTML and so I didn't
feel the immediate need to test them. However, for coverage sake I will be doing this. It was only
due to time that I decided to leave them.


## Future Additions

Apart from adding what was aforementioned, there are a few features I would like to add.

1. Restart game button

Currently when the game finishes and the dirt patch is cleaned there is no way to restart the game (beyond refreshing the browser).
This would be accomplished by adding a restart game button that appears once the dirt has been cleaned
or maybe just once the grid is rendered.

2. The ability to add multiple dirt patches

This is something that I also didn't add immediately as I wanted an operational and well functioning
MVP. However, adding it would not be too difficult. I would just make the dirt state hold multiple
objects of the dirt co-ordinates and then they would be mapped onto the grid. An 'add another dirt tile'
button would be added to the form at the beginning.

3. Use redux !!

I am not very familiar with redux so I decided to not use it from the beginning. However, it would
have been very useful for this project. Using react state is all well and fine, but when you cascade
state down components it gets a bit messy and the code is needlessly made longer. Wrapping my project
in the redux store and accessing the state wherever I want would have refactored things nicely and I
look to integrate this into the app in the future.

4. CSS the project more

I added a bit of css at the end of the project so that it didn't look like a potato. Even so,
it could still do with a lot more umph and this is something I look forward to doing.

5. Other smaller features

Roomba being more than a tile border, a Roomba image maybe? 
A counter of how many moves you make so you can beat your own record?
A randomise dirt tiles button?
A timer that counts down while you navigate the grid?
Many opportunities to extend the application


## Screenshots of use!

Below you can see a screenshot of the application once loaded.

This is the landing page where you insert your room, dirt, and roomba inputs.

After pressing the submit button the page reloads to show you the grid you created, along with
the dirt patch you inserted. Also Roomba is symbolised by the Hoover image.
You use the north south east west buttons at the top of the grid to
move Roomba. Once you move Roomba to the dirty square it hoovers it up and it
becomes a nice white tile like the rest of the grid.
